# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Tasks

### 0. Bubble sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

  - Prototype: void bubble\_sort\(int \*array, size\_t size\);
  - You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements \(See example below\) </br>

Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

  - in the best case
  - in the average case
  - in the worst case </br>

File:[0-bubble\_sort.c](0-bubble_sort.c), [0-O](0-O)

### 1. Insertion sort

Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

  - Prototype: void insertion\_sort\_list\(listint\_t \*\*list\);
  - You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
  - You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements \(See example below\) </br>

Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

  - in the best case
  - in the average case
  - in the worst case </br>

File:[1-insertion\_sort\_list.c](1-insertion_sort_list.c)

### 2. Selection sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

  - Prototype: void selection\_sort\(int \*array, size\_t size\);
  - You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements \(See example below\)

Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

  - in the best case
  - in the average case
  - in the worst case </br>

File:[2-selection\_sort.c](2-selection_sort.c), [2-O](2-O)

### 3. Quick sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

  - Prototype: void quick\_sort\(int \*array, size\_t size\);
  - You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
  - The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
  - You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements \(See example below\) </br>

Write in the file 3-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

  - in the best case
  - in the average case
  - in the worst case </br>

File:[3-quick\_sort.c](3-quick_sort.c), [3-O](3-O)
